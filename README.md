# Dotfiles

My configuration files for bash, vim, tmux and so forth.

Those were initially forked from [mischavandenburg's](https://github.com/mischavandenburg/dotfiles) some times ago.
I'm still learning the ropes.

There are evolving slowly, and at some point in time in the future, I'll think I'll
restart from scratch.

## Setup Notes

The `setup.sh` script does all the symbolic linking.
I don't have a tool to download the tools themselves
(e.g., you need to get nvim yourselves).
